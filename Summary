- What I did?
Ibuild a simulated railroad crossing model: I will create  a mini train which people can control them to move
across the railroad and crossway. Using traffic light create different situation. 

- How I did it?
Laser cut the train and a stand box with rail road score on it. Using one arduino connecting with one continue rotation motor 
and 4 traffic lights(include 4 red LED, 4 yellow LED & 4 green LED). So when the motor rotate, it will slowly draging the rope
which connect the train. When the train passing by the light sensor, the light will change from green to yellow to red. When the 
train passing across the road, the light will turn back on green.

- What I learned along the way.
1.Testing is very important.
2.Always ask questions.
3.Check all the supplies before due date.

- What I would do differently.
1.Motor selection, I will change a continue rotation servo motor so when the train approach the end it will automatic goes back. 
2.Try to find out how to use two light sensor at the same time, so when the train cover the second light sensor then the light 
sensor will change the light from red to green.

- A description of the 5 most difficult problems you had and how you overcamethem 
1. I don't know how to set two light sensor to change the light.  What I did right now is culate the time how long the train will take 
to pass the road, what I got is 23 second, so I set the red light delay 23 second when the train cover the first light sensor.
2. Mechanism always broken during the testing. Do more testing and fix everything.
3. I shouldn't put the arduino under the box, it was so hard to plug in all the wires.
4. I have so many LEDs, there are lots of problems when I connect the wires. All the wires should have some order, and use color to 
differentiate them, so if there's anything wrong, I can easily find the problem.
5. I forgot leave holes for wires. But in the end I try to pull the wire out from the gap of the train rail.
